`June 2018 - June 2019`
__Senior OPD Engineer - Puma Global__, Ford Motor Company


`June 2017 - June 2018`
__OPD Quality - Turbocharger Systems Engineer__, Ford Motor Company

Lead current model quality improvements affecting the Turbocharger System across all EU engine programs. The role has required me to liaise with Base Engine GQIP Engineers, LHS NVH, Product Development, Manufacturing Engineers, Suppliers, FCSD, Dealers from EU & APA regions. This vast cross section of interface across skill sets, and cultures has given me an excellent grounding to work effectively in a global business.

I am responsible for leading technical investigation for Turbocharger System field quality. Using Ford quality systems such as AWS & GCQIS supports investigation into root cause analysis on failed turbochargers and failed engine systems. I am required to balance priorities between GQIP 3MIS quality issues driven by ECB and HTIS warranty spend items. I analyse and prioritise field quality issues for all turbochargers from large data sets derived from AWS, combine with DTC data, production volume date & detailed supplier analysis using data wrangling and presentation software (Alteryx and Tableau).

This big data approach compliments the standard Ford quality metric systems such as ECB & Warranty Spend Pareto, this enables me to identify trends in warranty data to prioritise issues that have the greatest impact on measured quality metrics.

My role regularly requires presentation of DMAIC investigation to senior management. Most recently leading a 6-Sigma DMIAC to characterise the Puma Gen 3.5 Turbo overspeed field issue, quantifying contributions from poor diagnostics, intake build issues, altitude effects, and customer use of performance enhancing ‘chips’.


`Sep 2016 - June 2017`
__OPD Quality Engineer - DW10F Base Engine__, Ford Motor Company

During my role as DW10F Quality Engineer, I lead the V44 VFG for the DW10FP built by PSA Herimoncourt, France. I was the SPOC between Ford and PSA for all field quality issues on DW10FP. This required me to travel to the PSA engine plant in Herimoncourt regularly for meetings and in depth assembly line reviews.

In my role as DW10F OPD Quality Engineer, I worked closely with PSA Tremery engine plant manufacturing teams to highlight emerging issues, and prioritise tasks for the team. I worked on-site to drive cleanliness improvements to the crank machining and deburring lines, this had a direct effect on reducing bottom end failures seen in warranty. I supported all ECB root cause analysis and processing for DW10F.

In this role, I lead DMAIC investigation in top engine quality issues including Overheat, Slow Start and Bottom End Failure.

I co-lead a 14D addressing the low pressure fuel clip design signoff. This required extensive escape point analysis with PSA and Ford Engineers, this resulted in a significant change to the fuel system sign off for future Gemani programs.

Outside of these role requirements I conducted a solo site visit to Delphi, Romania at short notice to support root cause investigation for a Stop Ship fuel leak issue that myself and the team successfully resolved.

Regularly conducted Tremery assembly process reviews in person, for white alert issues and numerous containments for ECB process.
